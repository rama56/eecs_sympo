										<p>Procrastination is the fundamental technique used in synchronization mechanisms such as 
										Read-Copy-Update (RCU) where writers, in order to synchronize with readers, defer the freeing 
										of an object until there are no readers referring to the object. The synchronization mechanism 
										determines when the deferred object is safe to reclaim and when it is actually reclaimed. 
										Hence, such memory reclamations are completely oblivious of the memory allocator state. This 
										induces poor memory allocator performance, for instance, when the reclamations are ill-timed. 
										Furthermore, deferred objects provide hints about the future that inform memory regions that 
										are about to be freed. Although useful, hints are not exploited by memory allocators. We 
										introduce Prudence memory allocator that is tightly integrated with the synchronization 
										mechanism to ensure visibility of deferred objects to the memory allocator. Such an integration 
										enables Prudence to (i) identify the safe time to reclaim deferred objects’ memory, (ii) have 
										an inclusive view of the allocated, free and about-to-be-freed objects, and (iii) exploit 
										optimizations based on the hints about the future during important state transitions. Our 
										evaluation in the Linux kernel shows that Prudence integrated with RCU performs 3.9X to 28X 
										better in micro-benchmarks compared to the SLUB allocator. It also improves the overall 
										performance perceptibly (4%-18%) for a mix of widely used synthetic and application 
										benchmarks. Further, it performs better (up to 98%) in terms of various allocator attributes 
										when compared with the SLUB allocator.</p>

										<p>Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) is an important metric for programs running on real-time 
										systems, and finding precise estimates of a program's WCET is crucial to avoid wastage of 
										computational resources. Caches have a major impact on a program's execution time, and 
										accurate estimation of a program's cache behavior generally leads to significant reduction 
										of its estimated WCET. However, in multi-path programs the same memory access can exhibit 
										different cache behavior in different execution instances. This issue is further exacerbated 
										in shared caches in a multi-core architecture, where interfering memory accesses from 
										co-running programs on other cores can arrive at any time and modify the cache state. 
										To ensure safe estimation of WCET, traditional cache analysis techniques try to statically 
										find accesses which are guaranteed to hit the cache across all execution instances. However, 
										this introduces significant imprecision in the final WCET estimate.<br>
										
										In our work, we take a fundamentally different approach to cache analysis, by trying to find 
										lower bounds on the number of cache hits guaranteed across all execution instances. For 
										shared cache analysis, we propose an Integer Linear Programming based approach and an 
										algorithmic approach to find worst-case distribution of interfering accesses across a 
										program. For private caches, we first obtain a precise relation between program paths and 
										cache behavior, and then use this information to make precise predictions about number of 
										guaranteed cache hits in a basic block and in the worst-case execution instance of the 
										program.</p>

										<p>Efficient memory allocation is crucial for data-intensive
										applications as a smaller memory footprint ensures better cache
										performance. Consequently, larger problem sizes can be run given a
										fixed amount of main memory. The solutions found by existing
										techniques for automatic optimization of arrays in affine
										loop-nests are often far from good or optimal. In this talk, we
										present a new automatic storage optimization framework and
										techniques which can be used to achieve intra-array as well as
										inter-array storage reuse within affine loop-nests with a
										pre-determined schedule.<br>
										
										Over the last two decades, several heuristics have been developed
										for achieving complex transformations of affine loop-nests using
										the polyhedral model. However, no comparably strong
										heuristics exist for tackling the problem of automatic memory footprint
										optimization. We bridge this gap by formulating the problem of
										storage optimization as one of finding the right storage
										partitioning hyperplanes: each storage partition corresponds to a
										single storage location. Statement-wise storage partitioning
										hyperplanes are determined that partition a unified global array
										space so that values with overlapping live ranges are not mapped
										to the same partition.<br>
										
										Storage reduction factors we report from a
										polyhedral storage optimizer, SMO, developed using our storage
										partitioning approach, demonstrate its effectiveness on several
										benchmarks drawn from the domains of image processing, stencil
										computations, high-performance computing, and the class of tiled
										codes in general. The reductions in storage requirement over
										previous approaches range from constant factors to asymptotic in
										the loop blocking factor or array extents.</p>

										<p>Android is the fastest growing mobile OS platform, this has made it the sweetest

										managed by the Android framework is hard to correctly reason about statically,
										failing which, these analysis' are prone to both being imprecise and unsound.
										Android developers access system and other critical resources like databases,

										<p>Stream programming based on the synchronous data flow (SDF) model naturally exposes data, 
										task and pipeline parallelism. Statically scheduling stream programs for homogeneous 
										architectures has been an area of extensive research. With graphic processing units (GPUs) 
										now emerging as general purpose co-processors, scheduling and distribution of these stream 
										programs onto heterogeneous architectures (having both GPUs and CPUs) provides for challenging 
										research. Exploiting this abundant parallelism in hardware, and providing a scalable 
										solution is a hard problem.<br>
										In this paper we describe a coarse-grained software pipelined scheduling algorithm for 
										stream programs which statically schedules a stream graph onto heterogeneous architectures. 
										We formulate the problem of partitioning the work between the CPU cores and the GPU as a 
										model-checking problem. The partitioning process takes into account the costs of the required

										distribution of actors across different processors/cores. This solution is then divided into 
										stages, and then a coarse grained software-pipelined code is generated. We use CUDA streams 
										to map these programs synergistically onto the CPU and GPUs. We use a performance model for 
										data transfers to determine the optimal number of CUDA streams on GPUs. Our

										in a model-checking tool like Spin. Next, to remove the dependency on

										<p>Event-driven programming is becoming a preferred style of developing efficient and 
										responsive applications like smartphone applications and browsers. This model is 
										multi-threaded and threads communicate through shared objects or by posting asynchronous 
										events. In this concurrency model, unforeseen thread interleavings coupled with 
										non-deterministic reorderings of events can lead to subtle concurrency errors. The existing 
										concurrency analysis techniques are primarily for multi-threaded programs; we extend this to 
										event-driven multi-threaded programs.<br>

										Android applications are a popular systems in this concurrency model. We have formalized the 
										concurrency semantics of Android applications and defined corresponding happens-before 
										relation. We have developed a dynamic race detector which uses this relation. Our relation 
										generalizes the so far independently studied happens-before relations for multi-threaded 
										programs and single-threaded event-driven programs. We have implemented a tool called 
										DROIDRACER, which has detected potential races in popular applications like Facebook and 
										Twitter.<br>

										A race detector can detect races in only a few thread schedules. However, covering all 
										schedules requires a systematic explorer whose scalability depends on state space reduction 
										techniques like Partial Order Reduction. Existing POR techniques reorder every pair of events 
										handled on the same thread even if reordering them does not lead to different states. 
										We propose a new POR technique called the dependence-covering set, which reorders events 
										handled by the same thread only if necessary. We prove that exploring only dependence-covering 
										sets preserves all deadlock cycles and assertion violations. We demonstrate that our

										for developers to reason about control flow in asynchronous	applications.<br>
										
										First, we consider event driven programs where events are dequeued
										sequentially from an event queue, and processed by invoking their
										handlers. A handler may itself pause, dequeue more events, and run
										their handlers in another programmatic event loop. In this case,
										there can be races between the paused handler and another

										<p>In many real life situations, including multiagent systems, agents often need to agree 
										upon a common alternative even if they have different preferences over the available 
										alternatives. Voting is one of the most suitable tools in these scenarios. Common and 
										classic applications of voting in artificial intelligence include collaborative filtering, 
										planning among multiple automated agents etc. Our goal is to study the time, space, and 
										sample complexity of fundamental problems in voting.<br>
										
										The typical setting may be described as follows. An election consists of a set of voters, 
										a set of alternatives, and a voting rule. The vote of any voter can be thought of as a 
										ranking (more precisely, a complete order) of the set of alternatives. A voting profile is 
										just a collection of votes of all voters. Finally, a voting rule is a function that takes a 
										voting profile as input and outputs an alternative, which is regarded as the winner of the 
										election.<br>
										
										In the first part of the thesis, we show tight sample complexity bounds for winner prediction 
										and margin of victory estimation in elections; design optimal algorithms for finding the 
										winner in a stream of votes; prove tight bounds on query cmplexity for preference elicitation 
										for various important domains of preferences; establish parameterized complexity dichotomy 
										for committee selection problem in the presence of outliers.<br>
										
										In the second part of the thesis, we study classical computation complexity and parameterized

										<p>Hypergraph partitioning lies at the heart of various problems in engineering and science. 
										While partitioning uniform hypergraphs is required in computer vision, non-uniform hypergraph 
										partitioning has applications in database systems, circuit design etc. Hypergraph partitioning 
										is typically a NP-hard problem. Yet, over the last two decades, several efficient heuristics 
										are known in the literature and their empirical success is widely appreciated. In contrast to 
										the extensive studies related to graph partitioning, theoretical guarantees of hypergraph 
										partitioning approaches are not known in the literature. The purpose of our work is to 
										establish, for the first time, the statistical error bounds for spectral algorithms for 
										partitioning uniform and non-uniform hypergraphs.<br>
										The mathematical framework is the following. Consider a set of n vertices, which are divided 
										into k classes. A random hypergraph is generated on the n vertices by independently adding 
										subsets of the vertices to the edge set with probabilities depending on the labels of the 
										participating vertices. We provide an upper bound on the number of disagreements between the 
										true class labels, and the labels obtained from spectral algorithms for hypergraph 
										partitioning. We show that under certain conditions, the error is o(n) with high probability. 
										In the literature, such error bounds are only known in the case of graphs, where the model 
										coincides with the popular stochastic block model. Our results are based on matrix 
										concentration inequalities and perturbation bounds, and the derived bounds can be used to 
										comment on the consistency of spectral hypergraph partitioning algorithms.</p>

										communication must take place through the relay. We give two secure protocols for 
										this problem and study their performance. In the second problem, we consider the

										<p>Efficient resource planning in energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (WSN) is of 
										immense practical significance. However, it is encumbered by the sheer diversity of 
										parameters that affect the performance of such WSNs. In this paper, we propose a unified

										To this end, we propose an intuitive utility function to quantify the Quality of Monitoring

										problem, whose optimal solution serves as a metric to compare different deployment scenarios. 
										This resource allocation problem is subject to energy and capacity constraints inherent to

										<p>Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology that enables reuse of underutilized 
										spectrum and helps mitigate the severe spectrum shortage faced by society today. In underlay 
										mode of CR, a cognitive user can transmit concurrently with a higher priority primary user, 
										but the interference it causes to the primary user must be constrained. These interference 
										constraints severely limit the performance of the cognitive users.<br>
										
										We develop advanced cooperative relaying techniques to address this issue. In it, one among 
										the available cognitive nodes called relays that are in the vicinity of the cognitive users 
										is selected to forward the signals transmitted by the cognitive transmitter to its receiver. 
										We develop novel relay selection rules that are optimized for either maximizing the

										All these rules satisfy a constraint on the average interference caused to the primary.<br>

										The proposed rules determine which relay to select and whether to select none of the

										several ad hoc relay selection rules proposed in the literature. We also analyze the 
										performance of the proposed rules by deriving closed-form expressions for the average

										<p>Csiszar and Narayan introduced the problem of secret key (SK) generation in the 
										multiterminal source model. The multiterminal source model consists of a set of terminals 
										observing i.i.d. copies of correlated discrete random variables. The terminals are allowed 
										to communicate over a noiseless public channel. The aim is to generate a group key secured 
										from a passive eavesdropper listening to the public channel. Csiszar and Narayan evaluated 
										the SK capacity, i.e., the maximum rate of a secret key. The key capacity was achieved 
										through a communication for omniscience. Here, omniscience refers to each terminal recovering 
										the observations of the remaining terminals. The focus of this work is to characterize 
										the communication complexity of SK generation (R_SK), i.e., the minimum rate of 
										communication required to generate a secret key of maximum rate. The omniscience protocol 
										of Csiszar and Narayan ensures that R_SK\leq R_CO, R_CO being the minimum rate of 
										communication for omniscience. Following the work of Tyagi for two terminals, we obtain a 
										lower bound on R_SK for the case of m\geq 2 terminals. Sufficient conditions for

										<p>In this work, we consider retransmission based point-to-point dual energy harvesting

										if it is not delivered within a fixed number of transmission attempts. The goal is to 
										determine the optimal battery size as well as to design retransmission index-based transmit 
										power policy(RIP), which minimizes the packet drop probability (PDP) while maintaining

										<p>Rate adaptation and scheduling have become indispensable in current and next generation 
										cellular systems since they improve the spectral efficiency by adapting the user the base 
										station (BS) transmits to and the transmit rate depending on the channel conditions. To do 
										so, the BS needs the downlink channel state information (CSI). Hence, the users must feed 
										them back to the BS, which expends uplink radio resources. Since this feedback could 
										overwhelm the uplink, several reduced feedback schemes have been proposed in the literature 
										that trades off between feedback overhead and the loss in throughput due to reduced CSI.<br>
										
										For the practically important best-M scheme, in which each user feeds back only its M 
										strongest subchannels and their indices to the BS, we develop minimum mean square error 
										(MMSE) and throughput-optimal approaches that enable the BS to transmit reliably even on 
										subchannels not fed back by any user. In the former, an MMSE estimate of the SNR is generated 
										at the BS for subchannels not reported by a user. In the latter, the user and its transmit 
										rate are selected so as to maximize the throughput. This approach provides a fundamental 
										limit on the achievable throughput. The novelty of these approaches lies in their 
										exploitation of the structure of the best-M feedback information and the correlation among

										analysis. Emergence of signal analysis in analog domain can be attributed to the development of 
										dispersive delay lines (DDL). In this regard, all-pass networks (APN) have been explored as a 
										potential wide-band, high resolution DDL. An iterative procedure is developed to design APN 
										circuits for monotonous group delay response at radio frequencies. They exhibit linear and 
										non-linear group delay responses with both positive and negative slopes. The design is 
										extended for surface mount device implementation to accommodate mounting pads, component

										<p>High-power induction motor (IM) drives suffer from high energy loss on account of 
										switching whereas, in high-speed motor drives, the maximum modulation frequency is quite 
										high. Hence, in both the cases, the ratio of switching frequency to modulation frequency, 
										i.e. the pulse number P, is quite low. Such motor drives suffer from high total harmonic 
										distortion (THD) in line current and pulsating torque. While the thesis addresses both the

										Two optimal PWM techniques are proposed to minimize pulsating torque in IM drives operating

										induce sustained sub-harmonic oscillations in the currents, torque and speed of a 100-kW

										standard dynamic equations of the induction motor, to derive the proposed dynamic model for 
										inverter-fed induction motor in the synchronous reference frame. A small-signal model of

										out the region of oscillatory behaviour of the 100-kW motor drive on the voltage versus

										To mitigate the oscillatory behaviour of the drive, an active damping scheme is proposed.

										The first is a nine-level topology for driving a three-phase open-end induction motor. The proposed topology is powered by
										two unequal, isolated DC sources and has only eight switches and two capacitors per phase. The capacitors do not require
										pre-charging and are charged at startup using the motor phase currents. The capacitor voltages are balanced at switching

										published standards/guides on its use and interpretation. Having said that, the diagnostic

										Driven by this motivation, a theoretical analysis of the problem of localization of an

										non-convex $\ell_p$-norm ($0 \le p \le 1$) as the sparsity inducing penalty function. 
										Since the penalty function is not differentiable at the origin, we consider an 
										$\epsilon$-regularized $\ell_p$-norm substitute for optimization. In addition to the 
										penalty function being non-convex, the data term is non-convex since both filter and 
										excitation are unknown. Thus, the overall cost function becomes non-convex. We propose to 
										optimize the cost function using an {\it alternating minimization (Alt. Min.) strategy}, 
										and develop an alternating $\ell_p-\ell_2$ algorithm (ALPA). In the estimation of the 
										excitation, the ensuing cost function is also non-convex and is optimized using 
										majorization-minimization technique. Convergence analysis of the algorithm shows that the 
										majorized cost function and the original $\ell_p$-norm-based cost function are 
										non-increasing in every step of Alt. Min. provided that the $\epsilon$ parameter is chosen 
										suitably. We also analyze the use of pseudo-inverse solution as an initialization. With 
										respect to the excitation, we derive tail probabilistic bounds for the average absolute 
										deviation of the least-squares initialization from the true excitation and the bound 
										depends on the conditioning of the system. As an application, we consider the problem of 
										blind deconvolution of speech signals and show that ALPA yields a sparse excitation 
										(sparser than state-of-the-art).</p>

										<p>Civic crowdfunding is emerging as a popular means to generate funding from citizens for 
										public and community projects. The private financing of a public project is not a new 
										phenomenon and has received significant attention in the literature. At the heart of the 
										issue is the free-riding problem: since public projects are non-excludable and non-rival, 
										agents have an incentive to free-ride on the contributions of others. Civic crowdfunding 
										has two salient features (i) Crowdfunding relies on voluntary contributions and hence 
										neither coercion nor punishment is an option. (ii) Since contributions arrive over time, 
										an agent is able to observe the contributions of the agents who have contributed so far 
										for the public project.<br>
										
										We design mechanisms for crowdfunding platforms with sequentially arriving agents. Our 
										mechanism uses a prediction market to award, to each contributing agent, an appropriate 
										number of securities based on the quantum and the timing of his contribution. If the 
										project is not fully funded, each agent is refunded an amount equal to the number of 
										securities awarded to him. With our approach, we prove, under reasonable technical 
										assumptions, that there is a non-empty set of sub-game perfect equilibria of the 
										induced game such that it is best for each agent to contribute immediately upon arrival, 
										an amount proportional to his true value for the project, and moreover, the project 
										achieves full funding at these equilibria. We evaluate the performance of our mechanism 
										employing logarithmic and quadratic scoring rule based markets.</p>

										<p>This talk primarily considers stochastic approximation algorithms (SAA) wherein
										the mean fields are set-valued. Applications to optimization, reinforcement
										learning and supervised learning are presented.
										
										When analyzing SAA the almost sure boundedness (stability) of the iterates
										is often assumed. However, in many practical applications, this assumption is
										not easy to verify. We present two sets of sufficient conditions that guarantee the
										stability and convergence of SAA including those with set-valued mean fields.
										As an application, we discuss a solution to the “approximate drift problem”.
										In gradient based learning algorithms, gradient estimates are used instead of
										true gradients resulting in estimation errors at each stage. Prior literature
										on gradient methods with errors including Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (2000)
										“couple” the estimation error and step-size and this coupling could affect the
										learning rate. We use our framework to eliminate such “couplings” and unlike
										previous works we do not need the errors to vanish over time.
										
										Next, we discuss a framework to analyze two timescale SAA with set-valued
										mean fields. As an application, we use this framework to analyze the two
										timescale SAA corresponding to the Lagrangian dual problem in optimization
										theory. We use the Lagrangian dual problem to bring out the advantages of
										our framework over all previous frameworks. Finally, we present easily verifiable
										sufficient conditions for the stability and convergence of SAA with ‘controlled
										Markov’ noise. Such algorithms arise naturally in reinforcement learning. As an
										application, we present an improvement to a general form of temporal difference
										learning algorithms.</p>

										<p>1, In our first work, we address the problem of segmentation of collections of sequence 
										data such as documents through the nonparametric Block Exchangeable model(BEM) that captures 
										the new notion of Block Exchangeability. We show that Block Exchangeability lies in between 
										Markov Exchangeability and Complete Exchangeability for which segmentation is meaningful, 
										leads to scalable inference and parametrically, contains sparser number of transition 
										parameters.<br> 
										
										2, Subsequently, in our second work, we explore the sparse relationships for dyadic data, 
										where we explore sparse relationships between the domain entities and the topic, such as 
										user-topic and document-topic relationships through sparse matrix tri-factorization 
										formulation involving sparsity constraints, not only on the individual factor matrices, 
										but also on the product of two of the factors via the surrogate through L1-regularization.<br> 
										
										3, Finally, in the third work, we address the problem of entity resolution in dyadic data, 
										where the goal is to identify real users associated with the user references in the 
										documents. For this, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric `Sparse entity resolution model' 
										(SERM) exploring the sparse relationships between the grouped data i.e., grouping of the 
										documents, and the topics, author entities in the group via the Indian Buffet process and 
										also exploit the sparseness between an author entity and the associated author aliases

										<p>Optimal auctions are the auction mechanisms that generate the highest expected revenue 
										to the seller. Consider the setting when only one buyer participates in the auction. The 
										optimal auction mechanism when there is only a single good to be sold, was proved (in 
										[Myerson 1981]) to be a take-it-or-leave-it offer at a reserve price that depends only on 
										the distribution of the valuation of the buyer. The general problem of optimal auctions 
										when there are two items to be sold, remains unsolved yet. The solution when the 
										distribution of valuations is uniform in $[0,b_1]\times[0,b_2]$ is known from 
										[Daskalakis et al. 2013]. Taking cue from this solution, we solve the problem of finding 
										the optimal auction when the valuations of the buyer are distributed in any arbitrary 
										rectangle $[c_1,c_1+b_1]\times[c_2,c_2+b_2]$ in the positive quadrant. We conjecture that 
										our solution methodology can be used to solve a wider class of distributions. We have some

										<p>We describe a decision-theoretic model for visual search. We first model visual search 
										as an active sequential hypothesis testing problem. Our analysis suggests an appropriate 
										neuronal dissimilarity index which correlates strongly with the reciprocal of search times. 
										We will then consider a scenario where the subject has to find an oddball image, but without 
										any prior knowledge of the oddball and distractor images. We model this scenario as one of 
										detecting an odd Poisson point process having a rate different from the common rate of the 
										others. The revised model suggests a new neuronal dissimilarity index. The new dissimilarity 
										index is also strongly correlated with the behavioural data.<br>
										
										We thus propose a framework for connecting the perceptual distances in the neuronal and the 
										behavioural spaces. Our framework can possibly be used to analyze the connection between

										<p>Campaigners, advertisers and activists are increasingly turning to social recommendation mechanisms provided by social media for promoting
										their products, services, brands and even ideas. However, many times,
										such social network based campaigns perform poorly in practice due to
										the lack of recommendations beyond the primary level, i.e., the message
										travels only a few hops from its source. A natural strategy for increasing
										the hop count is to provide incentives for recommendations. Here, we
										address the problem of minimizing the cost incurred by the campaigner
										for incentivizing a set of agents in the social network while ensuring that
										the campaign message reaches a given number of agents. We also address
										the dual problem of maximizing the campaign penetration for a resource
										constrained campaigner. To do the same we use percolation theory for
										formulating two optimization problems. The optimization problems are
										non trivial and are not amenable to traditional approaches due to the
										involvement of a solution of a fixed point equation which needs to be
										computed numerically. One of our primary contribution is that we use
										results from reliability theory to establish some key properties of the fixed
										point equation, which enables us to solve the optimization problems using
										algorithms that are linairthmic in the maximum node degree. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of the analytical solution on real world

										<p>The Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) consist of a few 
										tens of SIMD cores and execute instructions from a group of consecutive threads, called warps. 
										At each cycle, an SM schedules a warp from a group of active warps and can context switch 
										among the active warps to hide various stalls. Hence the performance of the warp scheduler 
										is critical to the performance of the GPU. Heuristic warp scheduling algorithms work well 
										only for the situations they are designed for. GPU workloads are becoming very diverse in 
										nature and hence one heuristic may not work for all cases. To work well over a diverse range 
										of workloads, which might exhibit hitherto unseen characteristics, a warp scheduling 
										algorithm must be able to adapt on-line.<br> 
										We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based Warp Scheduler which learns to schedule warps 
										based on the current state of the core and the long-term benefits of scheduling actions. 
										The RL based warp scheduler can adapt not only to different types of workloads, but also to 
										different execution phases in each workload. As the design space involving the RL state 
										variables and the RL parameters is large, we use a Genetic Algorithm to identify the useful 
										subset of state variables and RL parameter values. We evaluated the proposed RL based 
										scheduler using the GPGPU-SIM simulator on a large number of workloads. Our RL based 
										implementation achieved an average speedup of 1.05x over the LRR strategy and 1.07x over 
										the TL strategy.</p>
