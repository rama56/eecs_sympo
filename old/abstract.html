<h3 id="title-scalable-program-analysis-techniques-for-software-bug-detection">Title: Scalable Program Analysis Techniques for Software Bug Detection</h3>
<h4 id="speaker-murali-krishna-ramanathan">Speaker: Murali Krishna Ramanathan</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying and eliminating bugs in software systems early in the development process has many advantages. A traditional means of achieving this objective is to do rigorous testing including writing unit tests and end-to-end scenario tests. However, in practice, testing has been found to be inadequate in ensuring software reliability because of its strong dependence on code coverage and the value of test inputs used. Sophisticated program analysis techniques have been designed to address these limitations. These techniques work by analyzing the source code or the program execution and subsequently detect bugs. In this talk, I will present the challenges of scaling analysis techniques to large code bases and present our recent attempts at addressing these challenges.</p>

<h3 id="title-high-frequency-system-modeling-aided-by-the-cloud">Title: High Frequency System Modeling aided by the Cloud</h3>
<h4 id="speaker-dipanjan-gope">Speaker: Dipanjan Gope</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With the increasing bit rates for communication, chip-package-system level challenges like signal integrity (SI), power integrity (PI) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) play a crucial role in circuit design. RLGC parasitics or S-parameter extraction tools have been used for modeling system level electrical integrity using different flavors of solution methodology: 2D, 2.5D, 3D. However, the complexity of analyzing full systems particularly with Maxwell accuracy presents a time and memory bottleneck. The fast solver algorithms of the last two decades have alleviated the problem to an extent, but the quick turn-around time required for design has been elusive. This seminar will discuss the recent trends in fast simulation and modeling techniques and the emergence of cloud computing as a unique opportunity to enter “simulation-in-a-coffee-break” paradigm.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Bio:</strong> Dipanjan Gope, PhD, is Assistant Professor in Electrical Communication Engineering at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. His research interests include computational electromagnetics with applications in signal integrity, power integrity, EMI for high speed chip-package-systems, antenna analysis and design, parallel programming for many-core and cloud computing. Dr. Gope is a founding member at Nimbic where he served as Vice President, R&amp;D from 2007-2011. Dr. Gope received his PhD and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle and BTech in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.</p>

<h3 id="title-recent-computational-advances-in-diffuse-optical-tomographic-image-reconstruction">Title: Recent Computational Advances in Diffuse Optical Tomographic Image Reconstruction</h3>
<h4 id="speaker-phaneendra-yalavarthy">Speaker: Phaneendra Yalavarthy</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Diffuse optical tomography has a potential to become an adjunct imaging modality for cancer diagnosis/prognosis. This uses near infra red light between 600 to 1000 nm to probe the tissue and is capable of providing functional images when multi-wavelength data is available. Due to the dominance of scattering, modeling of light propagation in tissue requires use of advanced computational models. One of the main bottlenecks for making diffuse optical imaging a clinical imaging modality is the computational complexity associated with it.</p>
<p>This seminar will give an over view of these computational models, including the recent developments at medical imaging group, SERC. These include automated way of finding the regularization parameter and data-resolution based automated choice of optimizing the minimal required measurements for reconstructing the diffuse optical images. The emphasis of this talk is going to be on open problems and associate challenges in computational aspects of diffuse optical tomography.</p>
