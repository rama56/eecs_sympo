<h2 id="jayant-haritsa">Jayant Haritsa</h2>
<p><strong>Brief Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Jayant Haritsa has been on the faculty of the Supercomputer Education &amp; Research Centre and the Computer Science &amp; Education department at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, for the past two decades. He received the BTech degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (Madras), and the MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin (Madison). He completed his postdoc at the University of Maryland (College Park), and spent sabbaticals at Lucent Bell Labs and IBM India Research Lab. His research interests are in the design and analysis of database systems.</p>
<h2 id="k.v.s.-hari">K.V.S. Hari</h2>
<p><strong>Brief Bio:</strong></p>
<p>K.V.S. Hari received his B.E. (1983), M.Tech(1985) and PhD(1990) degrees from Osmania University, IIT Delhi, University of California at San Diego, respectively. Since 1992, he has been a Faculty Member at the Department of ECE, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, where he is currently a Professor and coordinates the activities of the Statistical Signal Processing Lab in the department. Currently, he is also an Affiliated Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering, KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. He has been a visiting faculty member at Stanford University, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology and Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto Univ). He also worked at DLRL, Hyderabad, and at the R&amp;T unit for Navigational Electronics, Osmania University. His research interests are in developing signal processing algorithms for MIMO wireless communication systems, sparse signal recovery problems, indoor positioning, assistive technologies for elderly and DOA estimation. During his work at Stanford University, he worked on MIMO wireless channel modeling and is the coauthor of the WiMAX standard on wireless channel models for fixed-broadband wireless communication systems which proposed the Stanford University Interim (SUI) channel models. He is currently an Editor of Signal Processing published by Elsevier and Senior Associate Editor of Sadhana-Academy Proceedings in Engineering Sciences, published by Springer. He is also an academic entrepreneur and is a cofounder of the company ESQUBE Communication Solutions, Bangalore.</p>
<h2 id="ramesh-venkatesan">Ramesh Venkatesan</h2>
<p><strong>Brief Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Ramesh Venkatesan: Ramesh was born in Chennai in India. He attended Anna University, and graduated with a B.E. Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 1991. He then completed graduate study in Biomedical Engineering, earning an MS from Case Western Reserve University in 1993, and a DSc degree from Washington University in St Louis in 1997. He then worked as a research associate and as a research instructor at the Mallinkcrodt Institute of Radiology for slightly more than a year. After this stint in academics, Ramesh decided to move to industry and back home.</p>
<p>He joined the then GE Medical Systems' Indian affiliate Wipro GE Medical Systems in late 1998 as an MRI Advanced Applications scientist, which required developing advanced MRI clinical applications in collaboration with local hospitals. In early 2000, he was appointed as Technical Manager of the Clinical Applications group, which allowed him to interact and build a network with technical leaders in MRI, CT and vascular systems engineering. He then became the manager of the MR Applications Engineering team in 2003, and led the team for 2 years to establish a technically strong and globally recognized team in Bangalore.</p>
<p>In 2005, Ramesh was appointed the Prinicpal Engineer of the MR Applications Engineering team in Bangalore, putting him back in pursuit of a technical career path. He is currently the Principal Engineer for MR Software and Applications Engineering, with a focus on developing applications and systems of local relevance. He is also author of the book entitled 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Physical Principles and Sequence Design', which is world-wide recognised as reference book for MR imaging.</p>
<h2 id="venkat-padmanabhan">Venkat Padmanabhan</h2>
<p><strong>Brief Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Venkat Padmanabhan is a Principal Researcher and Research Manager at Microsoft Research India in Bangalore, where he founded and has led the Mobility, Networks, and Systems group since 2007. Venkat was previously with Microsoft Research Redmond for nearly 9 years. His research interests are broadly in networked and mobile systems, and his current work is on indoor localization and battery-efficient mobile communication. He was General Co-Chair for ACM Sigcomm 2010 in New Delhi, program co-chair for ACM Sigcomm 2012, and Chair of the Sigcomm Conference Technical Steering Committee during Feb 2013 to Jan 2014. He has also served as an affiliate faculty member at the University of Washington, where he has taught and served on student thesis committees, and recently also taught a course at IIT Hyderabad. Venkat holds a B.Tech. from IIT Delhi and an M.S. and a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, all in Computer Science. He has been elected a Fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering (INAE) and of the IEEE, and is a Distinguished Scientist of the ACM.</p>
<h2 id="javed-g.-s.">Javed G. S.</h2>
<p><strong>Brief Bio:</strong></p>
<p>Javed G. S. received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology(MSRIT), Bangalore , India in 2008. He is currently working towards the Ph.D degree in electrical communication engineering from the Analog / RF Systems and IC design lab, Indian Institute of Science(IISc), Bangalore, India.</p>
<p>He has worked in Bharat Electronics Limited(BEL), a defence public sector unit (MoD) from 2008 to 2010, on MIL-grade electronics sub-system design for air-borne surveillance systems. His doctoral work focuses on the design of low-power sensor interfaces and data converters.</p>
