<p>The Division of Electrical Sciences along with Supercomputer Education and Research Centre (<a href="http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/">SERC</a>) is happy to announce its <em>Fifth Electrical Sciences Symposium</em> on <strong>20 - 21 February, 2014</strong>. The goals of the symposium are to provide a forum for senior research students to present their work, networking among students/faculty and with potential recruiters, and creating an environment conducive to research collaboration within the Division.</p>
<p>The symposium will feature student presentations and will be held in the Faculty Hall at I.I.Sc. <strong>Final year Ph.D. / M.Sc.(Engg.) students</strong> (i.e., students expecting to finish their Ph.D. / M.Sc.(Engg.) in the calendar year 2014) of departments <a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/">CSA</a>, <a href="http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/">ECE</a>, <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ernet.in/">EE</a>, <a href="http://www.dese.iisc.ernet.in/ese/">ESE</a>, and <a href="http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/">SERC</a> are eligible to present their research at a high-level, in about 20 minutes.<br />
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Students are requested to keep the audience (students and faculty from the Electrical Sciences Division) in mind and pitch their presentation at an appropriate level, and manage their time well so as to finish the presentation comfortably within the scheduled interval. A set of interesting guidelines on - How to give a technical talk to a broad technical audience is available <a href="media/giving_talks.pdf"> here as pdf</a>.
