<h3 id="title-image-processing-using-approximate-nearest-neighbour-fields">Title: Image processing using Approximate Nearest Neighbour Fields</h3>
<h4 id="speaker-r.-venkatesh-babu">Speaker: R. Venkatesh Babu</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Nearest neighbour computation, a critical step in diverse problems like classification, regression, retrieval etc., is indeed a major challenge while dealing with large data. Practically, however, it suffices to find the computationally simpler "approximate near neighbor" instead. This is specially true of image processing applications, where the relationships between images can be computed very efficiently with such approximations. Of late, several algorithms to compute the "approximate nearest neighbour", such as PatchMatch, CSH, FeatureMatch etc. have emerged, leading to their extensive use in a wide range of applications that include image editing, completion, retargeting, de-noising, dense correspondence fields, object detection, label propagation etc. This talk briefly introduces the above listed algorithms and their applications.</p>

<h3 id="title-integrated-circuits-for-efficient-spectrum-usage">Title: Integrated Circuits for Efficient Spectrum Usage</h3>
<h4 id="speaker-gaurab-banerjee">Speaker: Gaurab Banerjee</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The electromagnetic spectrum, traditionally used for wireless communication, has become an extremely scarce natural resource. While sub-10 GHz frequencies have been widely used for cellular telephony, broadcasting and wireless local area networks, higher frequencies have been off-limits due to limitations in fabricating high volume CMOS integrated circuits. Due to continued CMOS scaling, such limitations no longer exist, and consequently, the industry is slowly transitioning to operating frequencies much higher than 10 GHz. At the same time, for sub-10 GHz frequencies, new techniques are being explored to improve spectrum usage.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will discuss two of the research areas that are being proposed to improve the efficiency of spectrum usage "cognitive radios and 60-GHz radios. I will talk about some of the existing challenges in the design of integrated circuits for such applications.</p>

<h4 id="speaker-mayank-shrivastava">Speaker: Mayank Shrivastava</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>ESD is a serious reliability threat to semiconductor chips, however chip technology, process, device and circuit co-design requirements for ESD protection is often not known to researchers exploring device, materials, process and design options for future nanoelectronic products. This talk will provide an introduction to the essential concepts of on-chip ESD protection devices and circuits. Moreover, research options for researchers in the area of materials, nanoelectronic devices, circuits and compact modelling will be highlighted. Finally, an outlook on the ESD device research in the advanced CMOS technologies will be given.</p>

<h3 id="title-face-recognition-in-unconstrained-environment">Title: Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environment</h3>
<h4 id="speaker-soma-biswas">Speaker: Soma Biswas</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Due to the increase in the installation of surveillance cameras, the problem of recognizing persons from their facial images captured by these cameras have become very important. Facial images captured by surveillance cameras usually have poor resolution in addition to uncontrolled poses and illumination conditions which adversely affect performance of face matching algorithms. In this talk, we will discuss these different challenges and different approaches that have been proposed to address them. This talk will also cover new and interesting areas of research in this field.<br />

<h3 id="title-on-the-convergence-of-the-hegselmann-krause-model">Title: On the convergence of the Hegselmann-Krause model</h3>
<h4 id="speaker-arnab-bhattacharyya">Speaker: Arnab Bhattacharyya</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>We discuss convergence of the following discrete-time non-linear dynamical system: n agents are located in R^d and at every time step, each moves synchronously to the average location of all agents within a unit distance of it. This popularly studied system was introduced by Krause to model the dynamics of opinion formation and is often referred to as the Hegselmann-Krause model. We prove the first polynomial time bound for the convergence of this system in arbitrary dimensions.</p>
