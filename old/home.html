<p><img src="media/home-building-2.jpg" class="align-right" width="300" /></p>
<p>Welcome to the Sixth Joint Research Students Symposium of the Departments of CSA, ECE, EE, ESE, and SERC at the Indian Institute of Science!</p>
<p>EECS-2015 primarily is a forum for presentations by senior doctoral students (expecting to graduate in 2015) involving the Departments of Computer Science and Automation (<a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/">CSA</a>), Electrical Communication Engineering (<a href="http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/">ECE</a>), Electrical Engineering (<a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ernet.in/">EE</a>), Electronic Systems Engineering (<a href="http://www.dese.iisc.ernet.in/ese/">ESE</a>), and Supercomputer Education and research Centre (<a href="http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/">SERC</a>). This year's edition will comprise 30 presentations by doctoral students organized into five sessions:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electronics</strong><br />
* <strong>Algorithms and Applications</strong><br />
* <strong>Networks and Games</strong><br />
* <strong>Machine Learning and Computer Vision</strong><br />
* <strong>Communications</strong><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlights of EECS Symposium - 2015 include keynote talks, invited talks by inter-disciplinary centres in IISc, invited talks by faculty members of the five departments, poster presentations, and an Alumni Event. The symposium offers a splendid platform for exchange of state-of-the-art research ideas and for networking among students, faculty, industry researchers, and alumni.</p>
