<p>Brief Biography:</p>
<p><strong>K.V.S. Hari</strong> received his B.E. (1983), M.Tech(1985) and PhD(1990) degrees from Osmania University, IIT Delhi, University of California at San Diego, respectively. Since 1992, he has been a Faculty Member at the Department of ECE, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, where he is currently a Professor and coordinates the activities of the Statistical Signal Processing Lab in the department. Currently, he is also an Affiliated Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering, KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. He has been a visiting faculty member at Stanford University, KTH - Royal Institute of Technology and Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto Univ). He also worked at DLRL, Hyderabad, and at the R&amp;T unit for Navigational Electronics, Osmania University. His research interests are in developing signal processing algorithms for MIMO wireless communication systems, sparse signal recovery problems, indoor positioning, assistive technologies for elderly and DOA estimation. During his work at Stanford University, he worked on MIMO wireless channel modeling and is the coauthor of the WiMAX standard on wireless channel models for fixed-broadband wireless communication systems which proposed the Stanford University Interim (SUI) channel models. He is currently an Editor of Signal Processing published by Elsevier and Senior Associate Editor of Sadhana-Academy Proceedings in Engineering Sciences, published by Springer.
