	"abstract" : "Consider n nodes, each of which has a single packet to transmit to all the other nodes. The nodes are connected via a random graph with constant edge probability p. Time is split into rounds where, in each round, each node may broadcast a single packet to all its neighbours. The objective is to minimise the latency, i.e., the time until all nodes have received all packets. We first study a random relaying scheme and show that it terminates in log n rounds (with high probability), with all nodes having all packets. Next we show that, with network coding, allcast can be completed in a constant number of rounds, whp.",
