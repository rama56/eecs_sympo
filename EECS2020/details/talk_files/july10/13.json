	"abstract" : "In this talk, we consider a (networks+learning) bandit, where N agents collaborate by exchanging only arm recommendations through pairwise gossip over a communication network to determine the best resource (aka arm in a bandit). We establish that even with very limited communications, the regret per agent is a factor of order N smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on regret. Based on joint work with Ronshee Chawla, Abishek Sankararaman and Ayalvadi J. Ganesh.",
