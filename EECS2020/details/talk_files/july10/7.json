	"abstract" : "When two systems pool their resources, servers or server capacity, and act as one entity, the overall system performance improves. Example performance metrics are blocking probability, waiting probability, or waiting time statistics. However, in many cases, one of the two entiies can have a performance degradation in the fully pooled system. Instead of full pooling, we could consider partial pooling. An immediate question then is how and how much would the entities pool? <br>We study blocking and queueing systems in the quest of an answer to the preceding question.",
