		                 Model based deep learning architectures for solving inverse problems consists
		of two parts, a deep learning based denoiser and an iterative data consistency solver.
		The former has either L2 norm or L1 norm enforced on it, which are convex and can
		be easily minimized. This work proposes a method to enforce any p norm on the
		noise prior where 0 < p ≤ 2. This is achieved by using Majorization Minimisation
		algorithm, which upper bounds the cost function with a convex function, thus can
		be easily minimised. The proposed SpiNet has the capability to work for a fixed p
		or it can learn p based on the data. The network was tested for solving the inverse
		problem of reconstructing magnetic resonance (MR) images from undersampled k
		space data and the results were compared with a popular model based deep learning
		architecture MoDL which enforces L2 norm along with other compressive sensing
		based algorithms. This comparison between MoDL and proposed SpiNet was performed for undersampling rates (R) of 2×, 4×, 6×, 8×, 12×, 16× and 20×. Multiple
		figures of merit such as PSNR, SSIM and NRMSE were utilized in this comparison.
		A two tailed t-test was performed for all undersampling rates and for all metrices
		for proving the superior performance of proposed SpiNet compared to MoDL. For
		training and testing, the same dataset that was utilized in MoDL implementation
		was deployed. We also validated our algorithm on chest and dyanmic breast MRI
		data.

		learn the spatio temporal correlations in the data across clusters. In the supervised

		                 Deep Neural Networks have been shown to be susceptible to overfitting in the
		presence of noisily-labelled data. For the problem of robust learning under such
		noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A prominent class of algorithms
		relies on sample selection strategies. For example, many algorithms use the ‘small
		loss’ trick wherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold
		are selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds which
		often depend on (typically unknown) label noise rates, and it’s difficult to fix or
		learn these thresholds. We propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample selection
		strategy that relies only on batch statistics of given mini-batch for robustness against
		label noise. The algorithm doesn’t have any additional hyperparameters, doesn’t
		need information on noise rates, and doesn’t need access to extra data with clean
		labels. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
		datasets.

		                 Building an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system from scratch requires
		a large amount of annotated data. For many of the languages in the world, there
		are not enough annotated data to train an ASR. However, there are cases where
		the low-resource language shares a common acoustic space with a high resource
		language, which has enough annotated data to build an ASR. In such cases, weshow that the domain independent acoustic models learnt from the high-resource
		language through deep domain adaptation approaches can perform well in the ASR
		task on the low-resource language. The assumption is that the low-resource language has limited audio data for domain training and good enough text data to
		build a reasonable language model. We use the specific example of Hindi in the
		source domain and Sanskrit in the target domain. The results suggest that domain
		adaptation approaches can help in the accelerated development of ASR systems for

		verification (ASV) is the problem of determining whether a test speech segment is

		inside the core network. Therefore, it becomes challenging to provide a service to

		             Sleep is extremely crucial for our physical and mental health, and deprivation or
		poor quality of sleep can lead to numerous health problems. Sleep patterns can also
		be used to diagnose neurological disorders like dementia, Alzheimer’s etc. Therefore,
		it is important to analyze the sleep signals accurately. Traditionally, sleep scoring
		is done by the sleep experts by visual inspection of overnight polysomnography
		(PSG) data. However, this manual scoring suffers from issues like subjectivity,
		high cost, time-consuming and inter-rater variability. An automatic sleep scoring
		system can be useful to tackle these problems. This work proposes a reliable sleep
		scoring method by using a fusion of multiple EEG features and an ensemble classifier
		called random undersampling with boosting technique (RUSBoost). The results
		achieved with a single channel EEG are comparable or better than the 
		state-of-the-art methods in the literature for both two-class (sleep-awake) and multi-class
		classifications, on three different publicly available sleep databases. The proposed
		method also provided promising results on the unseen test subjects using both 50%-

		                 The Intel Security Guard Extensions (SGX) architecture enables the abstraction of enclaved execution, using which an application can protect its code and
		data from powerful adversaries, including system software that executes with the
		highest processor privilege. While the Intel SGX architecture exports an ISA withlow-level instructions that enable applications to create enclaves, the task of writing
		applications using this ISA has been left to the software community.
		We consider the problem of porting legacy applications to SGX enclaves. In
		the approximately four years to date since the Intel SGX became commercially
		available, the community has developed three different models to port applications to
		enclaves—the library OS, the library wrapper, and the instruction wrapper models.
		In this paper, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the merits and costs of
		each model. We report on our attempt to port a handful of real-world application
		benchmarks (including OpenSSL, Memcached, a Web server and a Python interpreter) to SGX enclaves using prototypes that embody each of the above models.
		Our evaluation focuses on the merits and costs of each of these models from the
		perspective of the effort required to port code under each of these models, the effort
		to re-engineer an application to work with enclaves, the security offered by each
		model, and the runtime performance of the applications under these models.

		      Non-malleable codes are coding schemes that help in securing cryptographic

		                 The wavelet transform has proven to be a highly successful data representation tool, and is used in several signal and image processing applications,
		such as compression, denoising, singularity detection, etc. The problem of wavelet
		design has traditionally been approached from an analytical perspective, using tools
		from harmonic analysis to construct continuous-domain functions satisfying the admissibility criterion. In this talk, a learning based approach to wavelet design is
		introduced, which provides a coherent computational framework for addressing the
		design problem. Perfect reconstruction filterbanks are viewed as convolutional autoencoders, and wavelets are designed by training these filterbank autoencoders. The
		designed wavelets are data-independent, which precludes the need for customized
		datasets. In fact, high-dimensional Gaussian data vectors can be used for training,
		and it will be shown that a near-zero training loss implies that the learnt filters
		satisfy the perfect reconstruction property with very high probability. Properties
		of a wavelet such as orthogonality, compact support, smoothness, symmetry, and
		vanishing moments are incorporated by designing the autoencoder architecture appropriately, with a suitable regularization term added to the mean-squared error cost
		when needed. The proposed approach not only recovers the well known Daubechies
		family of orthogonal wavelets and the Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau family of symmetric biorthogonal wavelets, but also learns wavelets outside these families.

		     We address the problem of recovering signals from compressed 
			 measurements based on generative priors. Recently, generative model based compressive
		sensing (GMCS) methods have shown superior performance over traditional 
		compressive sensing (CS) techniques in recovering signals from fewer measurements.
		However, it is possible to further improve the performance of GMCS by introducing
		controlled sparsity in the latent-space. We propose a proximal meta-learning (PML)
		algorithm to enforce sparsity in the latent space while training. Sparsity naturally
		divides the latent space and leads to a union-of-submanifolds model in the solution

		the limited CSI and feeds it back to the base station. We propose interference-aware

		         MRI is an essential non-invasive medical imaging modality. However, it is
		limited by long scan times. The sampling in MRI happens in the 2D/3D Fourier

		Broadcasting information is crucial in ad-hoc networks such as Internet
		of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks which have no centralized infrastructure.
		Mechanisms such as flooding are not suitable as they involve redundant 
		transmissions. In our work, we propose and analyze a completely distributed, low complexity,
		energy-efficient broadcast algorithm for these networks.
		We consider a network with a distinguished source node that has data packets
		to broadcast. It encodes these data packets into n coded packets in such a way that,
		any node receiving at least k out of the n coded packets can retrieve the original data
		packets. The source transmits the n coded packets to its one-hop neighbours. Every
		other node in the network follows a probabilistic forwarding protocol: it forwards
		a previously unreceived packet to all its neighbours with probability p and does
		nothing with probability 1 − p.
		Our primary interest is to analyze this mechanism on random geometric graphs
		(RGGs) which are used to model deployments of ad-hoc networks. We find that
		with a judicious choice of n and the forwarding probability p, we can significantly
		reduce the expected total number of transmissions needed to broadcast data from
		the source. Moreover, while this holds for other well-connected graphs (grids, lattices

		             This paper studies a multi-armed bandit (MAB) version of the range-searching

		the real line) and a collection of (real) intervals. Here, with each specified point, we
		have an associated weight, and the problem objective is to find a maximum-weight
		point within every given interval.
		The current work addresses range searching with stochastic weights: each point
		corresponds to an arm (that admits sample access) and the point’s weight is the 
		(unknown) mean of the underlying distribution. In this MAB setup, we develop 
		sample efficient algorithms that find, with high probability, near-optimal arms within the
		given intervals, i.e., we obtain PAC (probably approximately correct) guarantees.
		We also provide an algorithm for a generalization wherein the weight of each point
		is a multi-dimensional vector. The sample complexities of our algorithms depend,
		in particular, on the size of the optimal hitting set of the given intervals.
		Finally, we establish lower bounds proving that the obtained sample 
		complexities are essentially tight. Our results highlight the significance of geometric

		           Data is replicated and stored redundantly over multiple servers for availability
		in distributed databases. We focus on databases with frequent reads and writes,
		where both read and write latencies are important. This is in contrast to databases
		designed primarily for either read or write applications. Redundancy has contrasting
		effects on read and write latency. Read latency can be reduced by potential parallel
		access from multiple servers, whereas write latency increases as a larger number
		of replicas have to be updated. We quantify this tradeoff between read and write
		latency as a function of redundancy, and provide a closed-form approximation when
		the request arrival is Poisson and the service is memoryless. We empirically show

		             The lightning return stroke forms one of the severest natural sources of
					 electromagnetic inter- ference for systems, both in the air and soil. Several physical
		fields govern this complex physical phenomenon, and most of the engineering

		unclear, and one such important aspect is the influence of soil’s electrical

		           SiC MOSFET is a wide bandgap (WBG) power device and commercially 
				   available in the voltage range of 600-1700V. With superior switching, conduction, and
		thermal performance, it is in close competition with the state-of-the-art Si IGBTs
		in this voltage range.
		Fast switching transient of SiC MOSFET reduces switching loss but may induce
		prolonged oscillations, spurious turn on, high device stress and EMI related issues,
		etc. The nonlinearity of the device characteristics and impact of circuit parasitic
		makes the switching transient of SiC MOSFET different from its Si counterpart. 
		So,modelling the switching dynamics and estimate the switching loss of SiC MOSFET
		is essential.
		Analytical models are derived through the simplification of complex switching
		dynamics. Estimation using this type of model is computationally efficient and can
		be easily implemented with freely available programming platforms such as C or
		Python. This approach is beneficial at the early stage of the converter design when
		switching loss and junction temperature need to be evaluated over several operating
		points for many available devices from different vendors. Analytical models require
		parameters given in the datasheet.
		This talk presents an analytical model to capture the switching dynamics of
		SiC MOSFET. A detailed non-linear model of the device along with circuit 
		parasitic is considered. It results in accurate estimation of transition time, switching loss,
		(dv/dt), (di/dt), and transient over-voltage. Also, an analytical model to capture
		capacitor-assisted turn-off switching transient will be presented. It helps design the
		optimal value of the external snubber capacitor for capacitor-assisted zero voltage
		switching (ZVS) converter. In this talk, we will present simple measurement 
		techniques to determine important circuit parasitic that impacts switching dynamics,
		such as the common-source inductance. We will also demonstrate software 
		developed using Python based on the presented analytical model.

		                 Bearings are crucial parts in any rotating machine, such as a motor, generator,
		or turbine. Majority (> 50%) of the reported faults in electrical machines are related to bearing life and maintenance. These problems are particularly pronounced
		in high-speed rotating machines. Active magnetic bearing (AMB) is a contactless
		bearing, which supports the rotor of a high-speed electric machine or turbine by controlling the magnetic forces produced by a set of electromagnets positioned around
		the rotor. AMBs are increasingly used in high-speed aerospace, industrial, and energy applications. Due to its contact-less and lubrication-free operation, AMBs are
		suitable for harsh operating conditions (e.g., extreme temperatures, extreme pressures, corrosive environment) as well as for clean environments (e.g., food processingand pharmaceutical industries). This presentation discusses the operating principle
		of AMB, its components, and a system-level overview of AMB. The state-of-the-art
		differential-mode current control of AMB and the resulting force-current relationship is explained. The main specifications of an AMB, namely, load capacity and
		force slew rate, are discussed. The existing design procedure of AMB is based on
		linearized magnetic circuit analysis, which cannot account for the saturation in iron.
		An improved design procedure is presented, which accounts for magnetic saturation
		and ensures that the force generated is proportional to the control current up to
		the desired load capacity. The improved design procedure can achieve both desired
		load capacity and linear characteristics while balancing the compactness requirement. The improved design also achieves the desired force slew rate, faster dynamic
		response, and enhances the stability of the AMB.

		                 Accurately fitting rational functions to the frequency response of modal impedances
