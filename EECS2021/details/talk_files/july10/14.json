	"abstract" : "Transmission scheduling for immersive panoramic video streaming involves the selection of transmission rates and coding schemes to provide a high quality viewing experience for the user. We will present a solution to this scheduling problem by formulating it as a multi-armed bandit problem in which one has more information than in a traditional bandit setting. Join work with Jiangong Chen, Bin Li and Harsh Gupta.",
