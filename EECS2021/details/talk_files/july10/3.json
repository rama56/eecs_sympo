	"abstract" : "In the mm-wave band, narrow beams are used to overcome path loss. They can be used to support high data rates with reduced interference. However, it is necessary to manage the narrow directional beams since they can become misaligned as users move, blocked as users rotate, or lose connectivity as users move out of range.  We will present an account of the opportunities, challenges, and some solutions. <br>[Joint work with Venkata Siva Santosh Ganji, Francisco A. Espinal and Tzu-Hsiang Lin]",
