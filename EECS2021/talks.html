              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>: 
                Inclusion of marginalized communities is considered a major developmental objective for all societies in this millennia. Inclusion of people with disabilities, born or acquired later, constitutes a very different challenge as it cannot be handled just by policies and political will. It requires major technology intervention. In this talk we present the work of ASSISTECH, IIT Delhi in developing solutions aimed at independent mobility and education of visually impaired in India and other low income countries. ASSISTECH has had limited success in disseminating the technology solutions that have been developed in the laboratory. First, we would focus on uniqueness of our Indian context and how these solutions innovatively address our needs including affordability. Further, we also talk about the challenges in translational research and dissemination that is critical for taking any proof-of-concept beyond the walls of a laboratory.

              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>:
                While AI has become ubiquitous in the daily lives of most people in developed segments of the world, it’s usage among the billions of poor is practically non-existent.  Yet, given that the a primary cause of sustained poverty and hardship is the insufficiency of human expertise and inadequacy of expert human resources, AI may actually provide opportunities to transform the every aspect of the life such as health, agriculture, basic education, infrastructure, and financial inclusion. Wadhwani AI is an independent not-for-profit applied research Institute based in Mumbai founded on this premise and with the goal of developing innovative AI based solutions to address the challenges of the lives of the poor. We are about one year old, and  have grown to a team of about 25, working in developing solutions for a few initial use-cases in health and agriculture, specifically in the areas of Maternal and Child health, TB eradication, and Cotton Farming.
 <br>
In this talk, I will described our approach to these problems, including how we select our problems, the technical aspects of our work, and how we propose to see our work have tangible, sustained and scalable impact  in the world.  I will also use the talk to share some the learnings from the first year of this endeavor, especially regarding some of the key challenges in doing AI in the social sector and how to address them.

              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>:Social media conversations unfold based on complex interactions between users, topics and time. While recent models have been proposed to capture network strengths between users, users’ topical preferences and temporal patterns between posting and response times, interaction patterns between topics has not been studied. We propose the Hidden Markov Hawkes Process (HMHP) that incorporates topical Markov Chains within Hawkes processes to jointly model topical interactions along with user-user and user-topic patterns. We propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm for HMHP that jointly infers the network strengths, diffusion paths, the topics of the posts as well as the topic-topic interactions. We show using experiments on real and semisynthetic data that HMHP is able to generalize better and recover the network strengths, topics and diffusion paths more accurately than state-of-the-art baselines. More interestingly, HMHP finds insightful interactions between topics in real tweets which no existing model is able to do.

                <b>Abstract</b>:
                Todays healthcare suffers from sever lack of resources and hence causing a steep raise in healthcare costs. In India we have 20,000 ophthalmologists and 1800 nephrologists for 1.3 billion population. Only 10% of the needed population is being attended and the majority of them either have no affordability, more so accessibility and availability of care when needed.
Digitizing healthcare can help in greatly overcoming these problems or it is better to say that this is the only feasible solution. Instead of patient go to hospital - hospital go to patient, is the new paradigm which can emerge out of this digitization. With our Digi Health Platform (DHP) is one step towards digitization of healthcare, the talk will focus on two such case studies one is in  ophthalmology  and the other in chronic disease management for nephrology. This case studies illustrates how we can get accessibility for quality care to the masses, perform task shifting and reduce the cost of expensive resources like health specialists and make care available anywhere anytime.

              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>:
                Virtual Reality technologies aim to provide a realistic and immersive experience in virtual environments to the users through wide field of view images, which are typically obtained by stitching multiple images with overlapping fields of view.  We consider the problem of Quality Assessment (QA) of stitched images for virtual reality applications. Our contributions are two-fold.  Firstly, we design a stitched image QA database consisting of 264 stitched images and 6600 human quality ratings. The database consists of a variety of artifacts due to stitching such as blur, ghosting, color and geometric distortions. Secondly, we propose an objective QA algorithm called the Stitched Image Quality Evaluator (SIQE) based on models of natural scene statistics to capture distortions that arise during stitching. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed quality model correlates very well with subjective scores present in the database.

              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>:
                As the benefits from transistor scaling diminish, an increasingly larger number of applications are making use of domain-specific accelerators, such as general purpose graphics processing units or GPGPUs. Relative to traditional CPUs, these accelerators often provide significantly better performance and energy-efficiency for types of computation it is designed for. However, a domain-specific accelerator may not be suitable to run an entire application and require it to be accompanied by a general purpose CPUs – giving rise to heterogeneous computing.  A key challenge to the successful adoption of heterogeneous computing is the difficulty in programming for heterogeneity considering vastly different programming models of typical accelerators like GPGPUs and general purpose CPUs.  
<br>
In this talk, we will focus on GPGPU, a popular accelerator that is specialized in executing massively data-parallel programs. We will discuss key programmability enhancing feature on GPGPUs called shared virtual memory (SVM). We will show that SVM could help ease programming GPGPUs but can significantly slow down applications. We will then briefly discuss our idea of smarter scheduling of memory requests that could lead to 30% performance improvement. Finally, if time permits, we will conclude this talk by discussing some of the other relevant future research directions that are of interests to the speaker.

                <b>Abstract</b>:
                Optimal planning of autonomous marine platforms is extremely important for their efficient use in a variety of scientific, security and humanitarian applications. In this context, we develop fundamental stochastic partial differential equations and efficient solution schemes for time-, energy-, risk-optimal paths of agents in strong, dynamic and uncertain currents. We apply our schemes and software to plan paths in a variety of idealized, realistic and real time operations of AUVs, gliders and ships in different coastal ocean regions. Notably, our planning rigorously incorporates environmental predictions and fundamental optimal control PDEs in a probabilistic framework.

                <b>Abstract</b>:
                Conventional power grids are being transformed into smart grids with the help of computer technologies. This has led to the generation of huge amount of data. Management of enormous amount of smart grid data poses significant challenge to the data owners. Currently, generated smart grid data mostly stay with the owner of the data.  Lack of a proper data exchange platform often prohibits the flow of data across various entities of smart grids. Exchange of data is necessary for efficient utilization of smart grid data. To address these issues, data market for smart grid has been proposed.  This talk will give an overview of Data Markets for Smart Grids. Market structure, participants, commodities, attributes of data pricing, data licensing, data authenticity and other aspects of the proposed Smart Grid Data Markets will be discussed.

              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>:
                Magnetic data storage has evolved from simple recording of a signal on a wire as demonstrated by Poulsen in the late 1890s to todays' recording technologies that aim at storage densities exceeding 4 Tb/Sq-inch. In this talk, I will cover the journey of a bit to be stored and retrieved from a magnetic storage medium. The talk will focus on various subsystems within this data recording technology, highlight alternative recording technologies from media/recording physics perspective, and the current research challenges therein. Towards the end, I will cover the basics of two-dimensional magnetic storage and its potential towards realizing high data storage densities driven by a systems approach.

              <h6 class="title"><b>From Simulation to Experimental Realization of Quadrupedal Walking in Stoch</b></h6>
              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>:
                Stoch is a custom quadrupedal robot designed and developed in the Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems at IISc. In contrast to existing approaches, we have used Deep Reinforcement Learning (D-RL) to realize walking in Stoch. In the talk, we will describe the methodologies used to address high dimensional statespace, transferability to real hardware,  and hardware limitations. We first generated walking gaits in simulation by using policy gradient based approaches. Having obtained the gaits, we then realized walking in Stoch by using a low dimensional representation of these gaits, i.e., kinematic motion primitives. This type of methodology improves the transferability of these gaits to real hardware, lowers the computational overhead on-board, and also avoids multiple training iterations by generating a set of derived behaviors from a single learned gait.
