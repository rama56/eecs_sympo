	"abstract" : "A common denominator of conventional financial systems, trusted execution environments (like SGX), blockchain technology, and ZK rollups is the promise of computational integrity -- doing the right computation, even when there is no trust. In this talk, we will define computational integrity and show how one can verify the correctness of a computation much more efficiently than having to re-perform the computation. We will introduce the notion of succinct proof systems that allow a prover to convince a verifier about the correctness of computation such that verification is exponentially faster than the computation itself. We will see applications of SNARKs (Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge), a kind of succinct arguments in decentralized systems like blockchain technology for both privacy and scalability issues, and outline the design principle underlying SNARK constructions.",
