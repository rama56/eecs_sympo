	"abstract" : "In a data-driven world, we have been co-opted into a contract where we pay for online services using our digital footprint. This contract places a lot of trust in the services providers, who often hide behind the fine print of privacy statements and misuse our data. Confidential computing is an emerging class of security systems and service that redefines this contract by giving data owners stronger technical control over how their data is used and shared. In this talk, I will describe the fundamentals and recent advances in confidential computing. I will also talk about how confidential computing can enable a new class of trustworthy data sharing scenarios that were not feasible or too expensive before.",
