	"abstract" : "Increasing  concentration  of  big  data  and  computing  resources has resulted in widespread adoption of machine learning as a service (MLaaS). The best-performing NLP, speech, image and video recognition tools are now provided as network services.  In such cases, the labeled data used for training may be proprietary, and different clients may be interested in different data  distributions often violating the core ML generalizability assumption of the training and test distributions matching.   This talk will discuss techniques for reducing such mismatch.  We discuss ways in which the server could exploit multi-client training data to train ML models for better generalization to client distributions when an explicit parameter adaptation is not an option.  Next, we call for a more detailed specification of a serverâ€™s accuracy where accuracy is not a single number, but a  surface over interpretable client data properties. Such an interpretable surface would allow a client to make more informed choice of a model from the burgeoning marketplace of cloud services.   We discuss methods for lightweight and heavyweight client adaptation of a blackbox service in the context of NLP models for topic adaptation, and speech models for accent adaptation.",
