	"abstract" : "When organizations looks to adopt cloud computing technology at scale for their enterprise applications, they are faced with substantial challenges. Having a public cloud available for use is nowhere near sufficient for actually adopting cloud computing for core business applications that power businesses and organizations today. We will look at some of these challenges and introduce the concept of Hybrid Cloud that makes cloud computing more practical. We will then see how innovations in the application of artificial intelligence to 'machine language' are enabling the adoption of cloud computing on such Hybrid Clouds.",
