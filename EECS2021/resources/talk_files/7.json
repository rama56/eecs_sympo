	"abstract" : "20th century societal transformations were created by the writing revolutionaries. However, we are far from done. Feudal oppressive choking forces keep all of India from its potential. The next wave of transformations will not be born in the written word, it will be born in code. However code as is today threatens to digitally colonize India, if not all of civilization. A few engineers in Indihood's research lab are dreaming up a new way to code that shifts power from software corporations to India's communities. This conversation will explore and debate this idea.",
