	"abstract" : "I will summarize our ongoing work on optimal models for vaccination, including the use of epidemiological compartmental models, network models and agent-based models. Incorporating different SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as understanding the differential impact of vaccinations on those with prior infections and vaccination history is a current priority. I will describe how we address these questions.",
