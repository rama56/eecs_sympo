	"abstract" : "Many science applications deal with data having an underlying graph structure, e.g., social networks, transportation networks, brain networks, sensor networks, chemical molecules, protein-protein interactions, and meshed surfaces in computer graphics, to list a few. For these applications, more recently, deep learning for graph-structured data is receiving a steady research attention from many scientific disciplines. In this talk, we discuss convolutions on graphs that form the basic building block of graph neural networks and discuss a graph neural network model with applications to COVID-19 drug repurposing.",
