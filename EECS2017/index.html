                            <p class="justify">
                                In the modern era of Science & Technology, Satellites have become an integral part of National development. The benefits of satellites are exponentially increasing and its usage has become imperative in every walk of life for a common man. Towards this, the Future Satellite Programme is highly challenging and demands for the realisation of 12-18 Satellites per annum covering a wide spectrum of application areas like Communication, Meteorology, Navigation, Remote Sensing & Interplanetary missions with advanced technology demonstrations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Communication satellite programme primarily focuses on bridging the gap of demand Vs capability of huge transponder requirements through High Throughput Satellite(HTS). The Advanced HTS is capable of handling 10-15 KW power to meet the country’s requirements in the communication sector. Further, advanced technologies like Electric propulsion system, I-6k bus developments, LEON 3 processor developments , large power handling systems, 18m unfurlable antenna  etc  are some of the critical technologies that are being pursued  to provide a High quality communication service.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                The Ever increasing demands for Remote Sensing Satellite calls for the need of  advanced technology demonstration like miniaturisation, onboard computer, onboard autonomy, advanced memory modules and data handling systems , large optics development etc in the Optical & Microwave Imaging domains for national natural resource management. Notwithstanding this, the programme also focuses on building sub-metre resolution satellites to meet the needs of varied user segments. Further the centre is also working on building GEO imaging Satellite that will be a technology breakthrough in the Remote sensing area catering to varied thematic application sectors for country’s development. 
                                Navigation is another important domain wherein the continuations of 7 satellite NAVIC constellation are being carried out. The NAVIC Constellation has also provided a platform for the participation of Industries in Satellite building Activities. The centre is marching towards realisation of next generation of navigation satellites with enhanced position accuracy services. </p>
                            <p>
                                 Over and above, the spirit of scientific temper and a move towards exploration of outer space is in full swing with the challenging Lander & Rover technologies, space docking experiments, interplanetary mission studies, XpoSat Mission, Aditya L1 Missions etc on the anvil. Critical scientific instrument developmental activities are being carried out jointly with the active participation of Science & Research Institutes </p>
                                    <p> The decadal achievements of Satellite programme has matured and the entire Satellite programme is undergoing a phenomenal change with a dual focus on Research & Development Activities as well as to scale up the satellite building capacity through active participation of Indian Industries in space sector.The lecture will highlight potential areas of Research both in short term basis and long term basis.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Modern enterprises face an unprecedented regulatory regime.
                    The cost of compliance continues to grow with traditional compliance
                    practices relying heavily on domain experts whose judgement determines
                    what compliance means and how to reflect regulations onto the enterprise
                    processes and data to make them compliant.
                    Compliance management needs to be automated to the extent possible,
                    so that compliance can be proved quickly, reliably, and maintained
                    through time- and geography-specific variations - while keeping the
                    business efficient. The talk outlines an end-to-end regulatory
                    compliance architecture and associated automation machinery.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Effective decision-making of modern organisation requires deep
                    understanding of various aspects of organisation such as its goals,
                    structure, business-as-usual operational processes, etc.
                    The large size and complex structure of organisations,
                    socio-technical characteristics, and fast business dynamics make
                    decision-making a challenging endeavour. The state-of-practice
                    relying heavily on human experts is turning out to be ineffective,
                    imprecise, based on short-term implications and lacking in agility.
                    The state-of-the-art is also found inadequate.
                    The talk outlines a novel line of attack to the challenging problem
                    of complex dynamic decision making.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Modern enterprises are complex systems of systems characterised by
                    multiple stakeholders with possibly conflicting objectives,
                    increasingly dynamic environment with a set of diverse change-drivers,
                    and constant pressure to maximize growth opportunities while reducing
                    “run-the-business” and “change-the-business” costs. Purely human-centric
                    approach relying on expertise and past experience has turned out to be
                    inadequate with the siloed nature of enterprises further exacerbating the
                    situation. Several architectures such as sense-n-respond,
                    MAPE (for Model, Analyse, Process and Execute) etc have been proposed
                    but found ineffective due largely to absence of sophisticated technological
                    support. Pervasive adoption of software systems that has led to
                    digitization of enterprises offers an opportunity of which the talk
                    provides a bird’s eye view.

                       OK, so you have settled upon a career path in research. That’s good.
                       A research career can be highly satisfying.   But how exactly do you go
                       about conducting research ?  Is there an app for it ?   Perhaps.   What
                       we do have though, is this talk in which we draw upon our past
                       experience to present some tips, which hopefully will assist you in your
                       efforts to set up a research plan.

                   <p style="text-align: justify;">
                       While the talk is aimed primarily at the beginning researcher, it will
                       likely be of general interest to all participants, not only because it
                       draws from the collective experience of many researchers in the
                       division, but also because it deals with issues that we all grapple with
                       on a daily basis.

                    Algorithmic game theory is an active and impactful area of research that in recent years has found many applications in the study of large strategic environments, such as online markets and auctions. A basic message that emerged from this area is in fact negative: determining game-theoretic solution concepts---e.g., Nash equilibria---is computationally hard in general.  But, given that such solution concepts are widely used in the design and analysis of strategic environments, these complexity barriers need to be addressed. Motivated by these considerations, in this talk I will present research directions that address hardness results for Nash equilibria, which are one of the most well-studied solution concepts in game theory. In particular, I will show that for a relevant class of two-player games an approximate Nash equilibrium can be efficiently determined. A key technical component of this work is an approximate version of Caratheodory's theorem; given the fundamental importance of Caratheodory's theorem, this approximate version is interesting in its own right.

                        Two dimensional layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit strong optical activity in spite of their ultra-thin physical thickness. This has generated tremendous interest in two dimensional optoelectronic devices. The exciton binding energy is extremely high (0.3-0.6 eV) in these monolayers due to the out of plane carrier confinement, large carrier effective mass and small dielectric constant. Screening due to surrounding dielectric medium reshapes the electron-hole interaction potential and plays a pivotal role in deciding the binding energies of these strongly bound exciton complexes. However, owing to strong quasi-particle bandgap renormalization in such systems, a direct quantification of estimated shifts in binding energy in different dielectric media remains elusive using optical studies. I shall show that by changing the dielectric environment, one can obtain a large photoluminescence (PL) peak shift at low temperature for higher energy excitons (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s) in monolayer MoSe2, while the 1s exciton peak position remains unaltered - a direct evidence of varying compensation between screening induced exciton binding energy modulation and quasi-particle bandgap renormalization. The estimated modulation of binding energy for the 1s exciton is found to be 58.6% (70.5% for 2s, 78.9% for 3s, 85% for 4s) by coating an Al2O3 layer on top, while the corresponding reduction in quasi-particle bandgap is estimated to be around 0.25 eV. An example of the implications of such band structure change will be discussed in a real device application.

                        Blood pressure (BP) is one of the vital signs that indicate current physical functioning of the body. BP is the measurement of the pressure or force of blood against the walls of arteries. Sphygmomanometer is typically used to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure by increasing and gradually releasing the pressure in an inflatable rubber cuff applied to the arm. In this presentation, I shall talk about measuring BP using an estimated photoplethysmogram from a video of fingertip taken by the camera of a smartphone, referred to as smart photoplethysmogram. I shall summarize the challenges and present initial results which suggest that the smart photoplethysmogram has the potential for cuff-less BP monitoring.

                       According to World Health Organization (WHO), cancer remains a global health problem and around 14.1 million new cancer cases were diagnosed in 2012 out of which 8.2 million people died. Breast cancer continues to be second largest cause of cancer-related female deaths in the world accounting for 12% amongst all cancer. Despite significant technological advances, screening and intraoperative procedures have remained largely unchanged for decades. The mechanical and electrical phenotyping has been demonstrated as a promising technique to study the progression of the breast cancer. Thus, a device capable of measuring alteration in mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the breast tissue quickly, accurately, and simultaneously will potentially open new avenues for breast cancer diagnosis. The design and fabrication of a Portable Multi-Parameter Cancer Diagnostic Device using 3D printing and micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technology is presented. The novelty of this work is the simultaneous measurement of multiple tissue parameters, which can provide a deterministic and quantitative information of the tissue characteristics, including mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics of the normal tissue from the onset through disease progression of the tissue.

                            <p>Fast data is a class of Big Data where events streaming at fast rates from hundreds of sources 
                            need to be processed and analyzed with low latency. These data sources span social media such as 
                            Twitter, transactions from eGovernance applications like Aadhaar, and observations from the Internet 
                            of Things. This talk will introduce such fast data applications, identify gaps in existing Big Data 
                            platforms to process such applications, and propose research directions on distributed processing 
                            abstractions using elastic Cloud computing and wide-area Edge+Cloud execution paradigms to address 
                            these gaps.</p>
