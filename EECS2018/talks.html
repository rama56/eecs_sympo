              <p class="talk-abstract justify">
                <b>Abstract</b>: We are witnessing increased number of large complex systems of systems operating in dynamic environment characterised by uncertainty and partial information. They need to rapidly adapt to the changes taking place in their operating environment. This is an intellect-intensive endeavour calling for heavy duty analysis and synthesis of vast amount of information. Towards this end, the current practice of relying solely on human experts is turning out to be quite ineffective. There is an urgent need to develop technology aids that can reduce the analysis and synthesis burden on human experts.     The talk will present 'digital twin' as a possible solution for analysing large complex systems - key aspects along with the rationale will be highlighted. Core technology components necessary to construct and put to use the digital twin will be described along with illustrations. Though intended for a general engineering audience, the talk may resonate somewhat more with researchers in modeling & simulation, language engineering, and dynamic adaptation.
