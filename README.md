Website of annual symposium organized by Division of EECS, IISc Bangalore

1. The code for EECS 2021 website was partially taken from the EECS 2020, 2018 website.

2. Bootstrap framework is used to set styles (specifically grid stylings). 
Read https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp for a tutorial.

3. The websites for 2010-2015 were originally created and hosted as Dokuwiki (https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) pages. In 2021, as the pages were incompatible with current Dokuwiki standards/requirements, they were converted to HTML pages using https://alldocs.app/convert-dokuwiki-to-html and hosted in the EECS website.
